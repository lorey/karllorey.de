This is a statically generated version of my old Wordpress-based, German website.
While I wanted to use Jekyll at first, I decided to use Nikola.

## Wordpress Import
* imported my Wordpress posts with Jekyll as this resulted in far better markdown syntax.
* redirects were generated with `generate_redirects.py` based on the Wordpress permalinks and pasted into conf.py

## ToDo
- adapt template (it's still ugly)
- link to subpages
